# BodyskyTestApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.6.

## Running manual
  1. Clone the project and change directory to bodysky-testapp
  2. Run 'npm install' and wait for all packages to be installed
  3. Run 'npm start'
  4. Open your browser on http://localhost:4200/  

## What is included in the project
  A conceptual design of a main page for BodySky.
  All provided assets have been used.
  The application is displaying trainers' names and pictures recieved from the given API.
  List of trainers contains all 10 obtained JSON objects.
  List is dynamic and users have the option to scroll horizontally to view more trainers.
  Application contains an additional page (http://localhost:4200/main) for testing purposes.
  Functionality for dynamic horizontal scroll on click of an arrow button not implemented.
  
 ## Encountered difficulties
  1. The application uses an older version of Angular Material - as of now not all of the latest Angular Material features are             supported by the current Angular version.
  2. I minor Angular referencing problem was encountered - not all of the assets files were acessible through a relative path, therefore they are referenced as link sources.
  3. Due to the same reason all SVGs are coded into the HTML files.
  4. Creating the Scroll on click of a button functionality proved to be challenging for me.
  
  ## Positive impressions
  I am thankful the opportunity to complete a task for BodySky. The exercise itself was interesting to implement, and also served as a refresher to my skills and knowledge due to the fact that I have mainly worked with other programming languages and frameworks during the past year. It contained an extensive description and all needed assets were provided, leaving a good overall impression about processes and communication at the company.
  All inputs and reviews are greatly appreciated - looking forward to hear from you again!
